## Technical Architecture

The application is built on a robust technical foundation:

### Vector Database (ChromaDB)
- Stores document embeddings for semantic search
- Enables efficient retrieval of relevant information
- Maintains document metadata for traceability

### Embedding Engine
- Supports both local and cloud-based embeddings
- Uses SentenceTransformer for local processing
- OpenAI embedding API integration for cloud processing

### Document Processing Pipeline
1. PDF upload and storage
2. Text extraction using PyPDF2
3. Text chunking and tokenization
4. Vector embedding generation
5. Storage in ChromaDB

### AI Integration
- OpenAI GPT models for natural language generation
- Context window management for handling long documents
- Temperature and token control for appropriate responses

### User Interface
- Streamlit-based responsive web interface
- RBC-branded styling and layout
- Tab-based navigation for intuitive user experience

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rbc-financial-advisor.git
cd rbc-financial-advisor

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OpenAI API key
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run backend/app.py
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:8501

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
USE_LOCAL_EMBEDDINGS=True  # Set to False to use OpenAI embeddings
```

### Vector Database Configuration

The application uses a persistent ChromaDB instance stored in the `vector_db` directory. You can modify the database path in `app.py`:

```python
DB_PATH = "vector_db"  # Change this to your preferred location
```

## Document Processing

### Supported Document Types
- PDF documents (.pdf)

### Document Chunking
Documents are automatically split into chunks of approximately 1024 tokens to optimize for retrieval and context window limitations.

### Adding New Documents
1. Use the file uploader in the sidebar
2. Click "Process Document"
3. The document will be processed, chunked, and added to the vector database

## Simulation Engine

The simulation engine creates personalized scenarios based on:

1. **User Profile**: Personal and financial information
2. **Selected Scenario**: Predefined or custom situation
3. **Document Context**: Relevant information from financial documents

### Simulation Types
- Job loss impact
- New child financial adjustments
- Critical illness scenarios
- Interest rate fluctuations
- Travel emergency situations
- Insurance claim scenarios
- Custom user-defined scenarios

### Profile Format
User profiles are stored in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "applicants": [
    {
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "age": 35,
      "marital_status": "Married",
      "employment": "Software Engineer",
      "income": 120000,
      "household_income": 180000,
      "number_of_kids": 2,
      "current_assets": ["Stocks: $50,000", "401(k): $100,000"],
      "liabilities": ["Car Loan: $20,000", "Student Loans: $30,000"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## API Integration

The application integrates with the following APIs:

### OpenAI API
- Used for text generation and embeddings
- Requires an API key set in the `.env` file
- Controls for temperature and max tokens

### SentenceTransformer
- Local embedding generation
- Uses the "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" model by default
- No API key required
